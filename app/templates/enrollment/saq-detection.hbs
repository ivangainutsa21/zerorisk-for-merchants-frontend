            Please take a few minutes to proceed with the rest of the enrollment wizard, we will guide you through simple questions so that we can identify the correct SAQ that matches your organisation and the way it stores, processes and transmits cardholder data (payment cards data).

           While using the application, your organisation will evolve throughout a series of statuses, from the initial "Not Enrolled" status (this is what you are at this stage) to the "Compliant" status.
           <br>
           Once a category of SAQ has been identified and assigned to your organisation, your status will become "Enrolled" and you will be just a few steps far from the PCI DSS Compliance!
          </p>
          <p class="small hint-text text-justify">The application dashboard will present your status at any given point in time. Please note your goal is to become "Compliant". When being compliant, you will be able to download and submit your SAQ.</p>
